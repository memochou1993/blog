Hello Linode Support Team,

I am currently running a Go application inside a Docker container on my Linode instance, and I need to send emails via SMTP using Gmail (smtp.gmail.com:587). However, it seems that port 587 is blocked, preventing my application from connecting to the SMTP server.

Could you please open port 587 for my Linode instance to allow outgoing SMTP connections?

I confirm that I am not using this for spam or bulk email sending. The emails will be sent for legitimate purposes only.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,  
[YOUR_NAME]
```

Hi there,

These restrictions have now been lifted for this Linode, and you can begin sending email as soon as you'd like. You'll need to open a new ticket, or update this ticket, for any other Linodes that require email.

Please note that if this Linode is deleted, you will need to request that restrictions be lifted again. To avoid this, you can rebuild the Linode instead by following the steps in our guide linked below:

https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/rescue-and-rebuild/#use-the-rebuild-feature
We ask that you configure rDNS for any mailing Linodes you deploy. Our guides on configuring DNS and rDNS records within the Linode Manager are linked below:

https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/dns-manager/get-started/#add-dns-records
https://www.linode.com/docs/networking/dns/configure-your-linode-for-reverse-dns/
Please note that when updating DNS records, you may need to wait 24-48 hours for these changes to propagate over the internet.

Once your DNS configuration is complete, you can confirm that these records have been configured correctly by running the following commands:

# for checking the A record
dig +short $Domain

# for checking rDNS
dig -x $IPaddress +short 
We also recommend creating an SPF record for your mailing domain as this will help improve email deliverability. For more information, please see our Running a Mail Server guide:

https://www.linode.com/docs/email/running-a-mail-server/#spf-records

If you plan on using the Linode(s) for business-related mailing now or in the future, please keep in mind that we require business mailing to adhere to the CAN-SPAM act.

Finally, we recommend you review Section 2 ("Abuse") of our Acceptable Use Policy. Terms of Service or AUP violations may result in the reinstatement of SMTP port restriction or account termination.

If you have any questions or concerns be sure to let us know. We're always here to help.

Best Regards, Mike
```
